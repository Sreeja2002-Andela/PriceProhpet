# 🏡 PriceProphet  

**PriceProphet** is a machine learning–based regression model designed to predict real estate house prices using historical housing data. It leverages **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover key factors influencing property values—such as **location, size, and amenities**. By applying advanced regression techniques and evaluating performance with metrics like **RMSE** and **R²**, PriceProphet delivers accurate, data-driven price estimates for real estate decision-making.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizes correlations, distributions, and key market drivers.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Enhances predictive power with transformed and derived features.  
- **Regression Models** – Implements and compares multiple regression techniques (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).  
- **Model Evaluation** – Uses metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to measure accuracy.  
- **Price Prediction** – Generates reliable price estimates for unseen properties.
